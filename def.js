    text("What is an archive?\n\nIt is sometimes hard to define what an archive is since the definition of archive varies in different contexts. (Pearce-Moses, 2005) Some archivists describe archive as a subset of records kept for a continuing value of an institution. (Williams, 2006, p.14) While this definition does not fully describe the scope of this platform, it helps narrow down the definition of archive. Selectively, digital fragments generated by architects when architectural firms publicized their projects, are included in the platform. The platform acts as a subset of these metadata, discarding the unnecessary sets of digital materials. These records include not only visual data, but also textual description and audio-visual material. \n\nTheodore Schellenberg was a major figure to articulate a difference and division between records and archives in 1950s. (Toole, James M, 2000) This definition in pre-digital age still somehow applies to the case of this platform, where each of the image regarding a representation of a building, such as rendering, orthographic drawing and diagram, exists online to serve the purpose of communicating to some agency, which could be clients, professionals, students or researchers. Yet as soon as the image enters an archive, its function changes from communicative purpose to documentary purpose. This shift in function has defined the difference between records and archives.", 450, 110, boxWidth, boxHeight);
